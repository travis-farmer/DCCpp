# DCCpp
My own changes to the DCC++ Base Station (stripped down)

Original DCC++ source came from https://github.com/DccPlusPlus/BaseStation/tree/master-2.0 all rights belong to the original author, with the exception of any changes i have made.
All files with the commit label Base  Level Copy, are the original files.

Important note: this code may not work for you unless you are using the same hardware that i am using. and as it is under construction, it may not work anyway, given my limited testing prototype.

Arduino UNO

non-standard Moter shield connections, in otherwords, it needs to be wired off-board, or could be built directly on an UNO proto-shield from a bare-bones ATmega328PU chip and clock crystal.

the eagle CAD schematic (TO BE DONE) describes the connections.

Some code is original, most from https://github.com/atanisoft , with some modifications that i have done, and to my understanding from Atani, it is based on work i did in the past.
